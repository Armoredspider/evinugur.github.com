#Welcome to my website

This is the source code for <a href = "evinugur.com">evinugur.com</a>!

If you're seeing this file, it means you're on GitHub. If for some reason you got here, you're welcome to copy my website and use it for yourself however you see fit. I'm sorry about the dozens of broken commits when I'm working, I usually work on a computer that I can't install jekyll to, so it becomes particularly difficult to work without delpoying code.

Thankfully, no one ever goes on this site anyway :)
