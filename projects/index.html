  <p><b>Project:</b> Windows Program that emulates the laws of Physics and the FIRST WPI Library to allow our robot's code to run
	on a computer when physical access to the GNU-based robot and its hardware was impossible to obtain. I worked on the field rendering,

      Naive Bayesian Sentiment Analysis of LiveJournal</a><br/>
    <span class="date">(Private, Python) December 2008</span></h2>
  <p>For my science fair project as a sophomore in high school, I
    trained multiple naive bayes on approximately 3.5 million
    livejounal posts tagged with the top 100 emotions. Once the models
    were trained, they tried to guess the emotion of 1000 other posts
    they were not trained on.</p>
