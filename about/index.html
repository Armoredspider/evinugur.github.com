<p>I currently am a Junior in high school who's passionate
about computer programming. I spend a lot of my spare time
working on my <a href"https://theforceteam.com">FIRST Robotics Team</a>.
Additionally, I fufill a leadership position as one of the two <i>leaders</i>
or captains of the team's programming division. During this year round program, I've created
control code to operate the GNU powered robot, proprietary Windows programs to send and display
telemetry for the robot's human controllers, a simulator to emulate the robot, physics, and it's 
core libraries for development without access to the physical hardware, and more.

<p>Outside of robotics, I like to program what interests me. Which is usually something dumb to
entertain myself or my friends. I've written  a lot of stuff though, including some: mobile iOS and Android development, web scrapers,
Windows programs, jailbreaking utilities for iOS, and games. </p>

<p>I am capable of programming in C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, and VB.NET. As far as platforms go, 
I know my way around Windows, Mac OS X, and most common flavors of Unix and Linux based environments.
</br> I am currently in the gradual process of learning Python and improving my knowledge of nodejs
and Objective-C.
</p>

<p>My other hobbies include music, video games (and development), films, and spontaneous physics  
projects. I have a strong appreciation for puns and surreal humor. </p>

<p>Currently I offer small, task-based programming work on the internet on <a href="http://fiverr.com/ugurphone/do-java-assignments">
fiverr</a> for a ridculously low amount of money. I do this becuase most of my time awake is spent 
watching anime, so I figured I'd be <b>way</b> better off trying to improve my skills anyway and what not.
I make small amounts of money, and probably cheat the educational system a little bit, I'm pretty 
sure it's for the greater good. I'm not in it for the money, and if I was, that'd be stupid.</p>
